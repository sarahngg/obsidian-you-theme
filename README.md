# Material Obsidian
#### A theme that reflects Google's [Material Design Guidelines](https://material.io/) to feel native on Android, and beautiful anywhere else. âœ¨

For [Obsidian October](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-october-2021-make-plugins-and-themes-together-and-win-awards/24471) I will build an Obsidian theme from scratch for the first time. I am sharing my process on my digital garden: [Building an Obsidian Mobile theme in public](https://joschuasgarden.com/Building+an+Obsidian+Mobile+theme+in+public).
