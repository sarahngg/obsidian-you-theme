### Dynamic Colour

Pick your favourite colour ([*Illuminating*](https://www.pantone.com/color-of-the-year-2021) anyone?). From this source colour a custom pallette gets automatically generated for you. Dynamic colour makes Obsidian personal while not overwhelming with options. You can pick your colour through the plugin [Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings).

### Floating Action Button

Skip the thumb-stretching and switch from preview to edit mode right at your fingertips. Shades of dynamic colour quickly indicate which mode you are in.

### Dark Mode
